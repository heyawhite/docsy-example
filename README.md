# Perspective API documentation website

The Perspective API documentation website was built with [Docsy](https://github.com/google/docsy), a Hugo theme for technical documentation sites.

Detailed instructions for how Docsy works can be found in the [Docsy user guide](https://docsy.dev/docs/).

## Running the website locally

Once you've [cloned the site repo](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository) run:

```
hugo server
```
