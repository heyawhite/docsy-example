  Understand key concepts

These concepts are key to understanding the Perspective API.

*   A **comment** is the text to be scored. Each API request contains a single
    comment. A comment could be a single post to a web page's comments section,
    a forum post, a message to a mailing list, a chat message, etc.

*   A **model** is a dimension that the comment is scored on; for example,
    "toxic," "obscene," "thoughtful," "off-topic," etc. This is also sometimes referred to
    as an **attribute** or **model attribute**.

*   The API can return **model attribute scores** in different formats, known as **score types**. Currently, the only score type supported is a probability score between 0 and 1, with higher values indicating greater likelihood of the attribute label.

*   A **span** is a continuous section of text. The API can return **span
    scores**, which are model scores for particular subparts of the request's
    comment. For example, if the API only found one sentence in a paragraph to
    be "toxic," it could return a high "toxic" span score for the span
    corresponding to that sentence, while giving a low "toxic" span score to the
    rest of the comment.

*   A model's **summary score** provides an overall score for the entire
    comment. While the API may return multiple span scores for a given input, it
    will always return exactly one summary score.

*   *(Coming soon)* **Context** is a representation of the conversation context
    for the comment; for example, an article that is being commented on, or
    another comment that is being replied to. It is used in the analysis of the
    comment text; for example, when determining the "off-topic" model score.

    *Note:* you can send context with your requests, however our current models
    are not making use of it--so sending context won't change any model's
    scores.
