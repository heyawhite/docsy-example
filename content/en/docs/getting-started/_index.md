  Get started quickly authenticating and using the API.

## Prerequisites

You'll need a **Google Cloud project** to authenticate (but not necessarily host) your API requests.

Go to the [Google Cloud console](https://console.developers.google.com/) and either use an existing project, or follow these steps to create a new one:

1. Sign in with your Google account, if necessary.
1. Click **Create**, or click the "Project" drop-down at the top of the page and then click **New Project**.
1. Name the project.
1. Click **Create** again.
    
The project is now included in the "Project" drop-down at the top of the page.

## Quickstart

Follow these steps to get started with Perspective API.


1. Enable the API. Use the command line or the web UI.
    1. Using the command line: `gcloud services enable commentanalyzer.googleapis.com`
    1. Using the web UI: navigate to the [Perspective API's overview page](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/api/commentanalyzer.googleapis.com/overview) and click **Enable**.

1. Generate an API key. To authenticate your requests, you'll need to generate credentials for your project. Using an API key is the simplest option. Go to the [API credentials page](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials), click **_Create credentials_**, and choose "API Key".

    *Warning*: If you make requests from a client-side language like JavaScript, your API key will be exposed to all visitors. It's strongly recommended that you [add key restrictions](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/api-keys#api_key_restrictions) so that only your production server can use that key.
    
    Note that it typically takes only a few minutes for a new API key to have access after the API is enabled, but it can on occasion take up to an hour; until the API key is enabled, you may get errors of the form "API Key not found. Please pass a valid API key".

1. Make an `AnalyzeComment` request.

    Run one of the sample API calls below to get scores directly from Perspective API models. You donâ€™t need to build a model locally. 
    
     The command issues an API request to analyze the `comment.text` field for the `requestedAttributes`, in this case the `TOXICITY` model. Use the API key you generated in the previous step as the `key` param.
    
    * The following command uses curl, which should work for most Mac and Linux users, and which you may need to install. 
    ```shell
    $ curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data \
        '{comment: {text: "what kind of idiot name is foo?"},
          languages: ["en"],
          requestedAttributes: {TOXICITY:{}} }' \
        https://commentanalyzer.googleapis.com/v1alpha1/comments:analyze?key=YOUR_KEY_HERE
    ```
     In the response, the field `attributeScores.TOXICITY.summaryScore.value` gives the toxicity model's score for the comment. In this case, the comment got a 0.9 out of 1.0. Learn more about model attribute scores the ["Key concepts" section of our API reference](api_reference.md#key-concepts).
    ```shell
    {
      "attributeScores": {
        "TOXICITY": {
          "summaryScore": {
            "value": 0.9208521,
            "type": "PROBABILITY"
          }
        }
      },
      "languages": [
        "en"
      ]
    }
    ```
    
    * Alternatively, the following command uses Python:
    ```shell
    import json 
    import requests 
    api_key = 'YOUR_KEY_HERE'
    url = ('https://commentanalyzer.googleapis.com/v1alpha1/comments:analyze' +    
           '?key=' + api_key)
    data_dict = {
      'comment': {'text': 'what kind of idiot name is foo?'},
      'languages': ['en'],
      'requestedAttributes': {'TOXICITY': {}}
    }
    response = requests.post(url=url, data=json.dumps(data_dict)) 
    response_dict = json.loads(response.content) 
    print(json.dumps(response_dict, indent=2))
    ```
    You should see output similar to this:
    ```shell
    {
      "attributeScores": {
        "TOXICITY": {
          "summaryScore": {
            "value": 0.9208521,
            "type": "PROBABILITY"
          }
        }
      },
      "languages": [
        "en"
      ]
    }
    ```


You can leverage the `DoNotStore` flag to ensure that all submitted comments are automatically deleted after scores are returned and/or the `SuggestCommentScore` method to submit corrections to improve Perspective over time.


## Next steps

See the [API reference documentation](api_reference.md) for details on all of
the request and response fields, as well as the available values for
`requestedAttributes`. There are quite a few [experimental models](https://github.com/conversationai/perspectiveapi/blob/master/api_reference.md#models), such as "obscene", "attack on a commenter", "spam", etc., that you may find interesting.
